### Description

Multi-Sorting with controls like 'ListView', was always an issue for VB programmers. Here is a dome project of multi-sorting with 'ListView' using 'ActiveX Data Access Object (ADO and ADOR)'.

The Control has designed for single sorting / multi sorting with Characters / Numbers / date type data with ascending/descending order. The order of sorting has been indicated with the icon on the header. User also has possibility to change the arrangements of the fields.

I hope this demo could give you idea to do multi-sorting with list view. Any comments/suggestion always appreciated. Thx.
